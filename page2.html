    <h2>Connection With Maths</h2>
            <p>The Water ATM Machine operates using the Deterministic Finite Automata theory (DFA). The figure shows a DFA that describes the behavior of a water ATM that accepts rupees of 5 and 10, and prices ten rupees for 2-liter water, twenty rupees for 4-liter water, and twenty-five rupees for 5-liter water. <br>
            The user will be able to fill their water bottle once the machine has received the minimum quantity of money, which corresponds to the blue stages in the diagram. Neglected input is represented by self-loops. The machine will not deliver water until at least ₹10 has been put in, and after it has accepted ₹10 or more, it will stop accepting more payments.
