            <h2>Home</h2>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This is about water ATM. Over 45 percent of the non-degradable garbage that pollutes our oceans and land
                mass is made up of plastic bottles and bottle caps.</p>
            <p>The Water ATM Project is conceptualized by the Department to provide ambient cool drinking water in all
                seasons to the masses at an affordable cost. The Water ATM with Kiosk is the first of its kind project
                undertaken by the Department of Public Health Engineering, Govt.</p>
            <p>A whopping 70 percent of these bottles never make it to the recycling stage and end up in landfills and
                the ocean.
                It is simply not sustainable to use and discard a plastic bottle every time a tourist must consume 2
                liters to 5 liters.
                This packaged water system quenches a personâ€™s thirst once and generates a healthy profit for the
                business, but at a great cost to our ecosystem, which cannot support this process for very long.
            </p>
            <h2>Required Components</h2>
            <p>The components for this are as follows:

            <h2>How it works?</h2>
            <p>Water vending machines have begun to appear in public spaces, but there is a problem: -<br><br>
                The person using the water ATM does not always have coins on them. Here, we offer a very environmentally friendly solution to all these issues that enable us to provide water to visitors for much less money and without endangering the environment. <br> <br>
                Water is served by the smart water ATM upon coin entry and Card scanning. The user does not need to carry cash when using the ATM because of this.<br><br>
                An STM32 controller, a coin module, a solenoid valve, a keypad, an RFID scanner, and motors are used to create the system. This makes it possible to create a smart water dispenser device that can provide consumers with water on demand.   
                <br><br>
                When the machine is turned on, the user can choose how much water to fill it with. The system displays the cost in rupees (Rs.) from 2 Litres to 5 Litres once the user picks the volume of water to be filled. The mechanism waits for the water bottle to be inserted into the filling section after selection. Before a bottle is found in the filling panel, the filling will not begin.<br><br>
                 RFID cards are used to show how a monthly pass or card payment works and to give the correct amount of water upon card scanning without the need for coin insertion.When a bottle is found, the controller activates a solenoid pump that sends water through pipes into the bottle. The device uses a flow meter sensor to gauge how much water is being dispensed. The mechanism now releases the chosen amount of water and then turns off the flow.
